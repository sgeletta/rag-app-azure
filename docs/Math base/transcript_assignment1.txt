We're in assignment one,
most of the questions are just there for you to think about and
to discuss with your fellow students. And I'm going to leave you to do that and
sort them out on your own, discuss them on the forums or
with whatever group you've put together. And please do put together a group. What I will do is say a little
bit about question 8. Well, question 8 is related to Euclid's
proof that there are infinitely many primes. Another crucial point in that proof, we looked at this number where p1 though
pn enumerates the first n primes. We multiply them together and we add 1. And I mentioned during the proof that
this number is not always prime. And question 8 asks how would you
prove that it's not always prime? And the answer is you
have to find a number, n, such that when you do multiply the first
n primes and add 1, it's not prime. Well, how would you go about doing that? Well, the most obvious way
is you start searching. So you would start by looking
at the first two primes, say, multipy them together, add 1, you get 7. Well, that is prime. Try another one. (2 x 3 x 5) + 1. That's 31. That's also a prime. Let's try another one. (2 x 3 x 5 x 7) + 1. That's 211. That's also a prime. At this point you're probably
starting to lose heart, but if you keep on just two more primes 2,
3, 5, 7, 11, 13 multiplied together and add 1. You end up with 30,031, which is not prime because it's a multiple of 59 and 509. Okay? So here we've got an example of a number
of this form which is not prime. And in order to show that not every number
of that form is prime, all you have to do is find a single example of a number
in that form which isn't prime. And we've done it. So, that's the answer to question 8. That's how you prove that these
numbers are not always prime, okay? Well, that's really all I wanted
to say about assignment one. Assignment two has a little
bit more meat to it in a sense that there are more things
that I'll need to show you.
