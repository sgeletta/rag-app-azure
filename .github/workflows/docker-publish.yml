# This GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build your Docker image
# and push it to Docker Hub whenever you push a change to the 'main' branch.

name: Publish Docker Image to Docker Hub

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # This workflow runs on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a standard Linux runner

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # This step checks out your code so the workflow can access it.

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        # This sets up the necessary Docker components for building images.

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
        # This securely logs into Docker Hub using secrets you'll configure in GitHub.

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/rag-app:latest
          # This is the core step:
          # - 'context: .' tells it to use your project's root directory.
          # - 'file: ./Dockerfile' points to your application's Dockerfile.
          # - 'push: true' tells it to push the image after a successful build.
          # - 'tags:' defines the name and tag for your image on Docker Hub.
          #   Example: "sgeletta/rag-app:latest"
